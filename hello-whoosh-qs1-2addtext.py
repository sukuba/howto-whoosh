add text document

results:
_MAIN_0.toc is renamed to _MAIN_1.toc.
two files are created; MAIN_WRITELOCK and MAIN_xxh7q0wfd37x562g.seg.
The last one has indexes.

the 2nd run results:
no errors shown though the path break the uniqueness to the 1st run.
now _MAIN_2.toc. 
maybe, overwrite the 1st one?
another seg file is created; MAIN_x1ec288ljfq1ffi4.seg.
size matched to the 1st one, but the binary comparing differs.
